# friendship-oll
A simple friendship survey tool to collect edges in a social network in a class.

This is a complete (if minimal) web framework that 
handles the [WSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) 
request/response cycle, routing, controllers, templating, and a data layer, 
whose only goal is to collect the edges (friendships) in a social network.
